Repo for Over The Air lab.
Purpose is to handle a microcontroller Raspberry PI Pico WH connected to a breadboard with two yellow diods and a piezo buzzer.
These are simulating blinkers on a car and the horn.

Written in MicroPython.

Best tool for working with Pico microcontroller is Thonny (https://thonny.org/)
USB communication for flashing is simple with Thonny.
But Visual Studio works very well for development.

A Pico can run by itself connected to a powerbank using Wifi if a main.py exists.
Can be copied using Thonny.
